# Archiving notice
I lost intest in programming in NIM and as such I won't udate this docs. What's written here may still work, but it is really outdated.

# NiGUI-docs
My custom and poorly made docs for the NiGUI framework

## Disclaimer
This documentation his not complete, for furthuer informations please take a look at the NiGui exapmles --> https://github.com/trustable-code/NiGui/tree/master/examples

This is also **full** of typos

**[START READING](https://github.com/TheFourchette/NiGUI-docs/blob/main/doc.md)**


If you need a better documentation please read [matdhart docs](https://github.com/matdhart/NiGui/tree/docWriter/Docs),  just note that docs can differ cause of being documentation for its own fork of NiGUI
